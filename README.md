My visual argument, found under the title "WelcomeToAnkhMorpork.xcf," is a tourist poster welcoming guests to the city of Ankh-Morpork from the fantasy series *Discworld* by Terry Pratchett. In the books, Ankh-Morpork starts off as a terrible place to live, overrun with thievery, violence, and a bad economy, so I thought it would be fun to make a poster convincing people to visit. From the perspective of someone unfamiliar with the series, Ankh-Morpork seems like a beautiful place to visit, with nice houses and a fancy castle, and the detailed map in the background showcases the city's unique layout. However, fans will recognize the irony and know that people rarely come to Ankh-Morpork with the intention of staying.
